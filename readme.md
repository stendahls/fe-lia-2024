# Human backup

Recreate Stendahls' web at https://www.stendahls.se/ .

Use our live pages as a sketch to start rewriting our web. How far you get, how your result looks and functions does not matter.

What matters is how you write your code and structure it.

### Goals
* Do our start page first.
* Prefer to do a little bit of everything; HTML, JS, CSS, etc.
* Split the code into components and att structure where the repo needs.
* Write and add structure so that it would be easy for another person to take over your work.
* Make commits in Git with commit messages.
* Stuff should work in major browsers and both on desktop and mobile.
* Hard code everything.
* Copy content from our pages.
* Please feel free to copy code from our pages as well, however code in the repo should be used, easy to read, and make sense.

### Do not
* Do not get stuck on polishing.
* Do not get stuck on tooling, ops or deployment.
